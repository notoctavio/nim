At **Storyteller**, I'm part of a product-minded team building a Web SDK that powers interactive Stories for global brands in sports and media. My work focuses on **Storypilot**, a Next.js platform that leverages AI to streamline content creation and management.

---

## Role & Impact

My day-to-day involves shipping features end-to-end, from initial design to production-ready code. I work across the full stack, utilizing **AI-assisted development** (with tools like Codex and Claude) to accelerate implementation while maintaining high reliability through rigorous testing and first-principles reasoning.

- **Feature Delivery**: Building and testing well-scoped improvements to the Web SDK and Storypilot dashboard.
- **Reliability**: Fixing bugs and instrumenting code to ensure the stability of products used by millions.
- **Developer Experience**: Improving SDK documentation and building tools to make integration seamless for our clients.
- **Collaboration**: Working closely with Design and Product teams to scope and build pragmatic solutions.

---

## Technical Ecosystem

The project is built on a modern, distributed architecture that demands a high degree of technical precision.

### Frontend

The dashboard is a **Next.js** application styled with **Tailwind CSS** and built on **Radix UI** primitives for accessibility. The core SDK is written in **TypeScript**, designed to be lightweight and performant across all web environments.

### Backend & Infrastructure

The system follows a layered architecture using the **ABP Framework**:

- **Core**: .NET 9.0 with a clean separation of Domain and Application layers.
- **Data & Search**: SQL Server for relational data and **ElasticSearch** for high-performance content discovery.
- **Orchestration**: Local development is managed via **.NET Aspire**, while production services run on **Azure Container Apps** managed by the Azure Developer CLI.

## Conclusion

Working at Storyteller allows me to bridge the gap between complex backend systems and high-fidelity user experiences. It's a role that combines my interest in software engineering, AI orchestration, and digital media.
